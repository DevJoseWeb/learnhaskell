title: Case expressions

text: Many imperative languages (C, C++, Java, etc.) have case syntax and if you've ever programmed in them, you probably know what it's about. It's about taking a variable and then executing blocks of code for specific values of that variable and then maybe including a catch-all block of code in case the variable has some value for which we didn't set up a case.

Haskell takes that concept and one-ups it. Like the name implies, case expressions are, well, expressions, much like if else expressions and <i>let</i> bindings. Not only can we evaluate expressions based on the possible cases of the value of a variable, we can also do pattern matching. Hmmm, taking a variable, pattern matching it, evaluating pieces of code based on its value, where have we heard this before? Oh yeah, pattern matching on parameters in function definitions! Well, that's actually just syntactic sugar for case expressions. These two pieces of code do the same thing and are interchangeable:



As you can see, the syntax for case expressions is pretty simple:



[code]expression[/code] is matched agianst the patterns. The pattern matching action is the same as expected: the first pattern that matches the expression is used. If it falls through the whole case expression and no suitable pattern is found, a runtime error occurs.

Whereas pattern matching on function parameters can only be done when defining functions, case expressions can be used pretty much anywhere. For instance:



They're are useful for pattern matching against something in the middle of an expression. Because pattern matching in function definitions is syntactic sugar for case expressions, we could have also defined this like so:
